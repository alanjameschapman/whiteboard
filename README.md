# Agile Development
This project was developed using agile principles. The project took 4 weeks and was divide up into weekly iterations/sprints, which roughly coincided with scheduled mentor sessions. In this way, development was iterative and incremental. The Minimum Viable Product was deployed after the first iteration for mentor and peer feedback.
Story Points were assigned to tasks at the start of the project, and after deployment of the MVP a velocity could be calculated from the number of story points completed within that week. In this way, the remaining work could be better prioritized.
