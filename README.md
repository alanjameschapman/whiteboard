# Agile Development
This project was developed and [documented](docs/AGILE.md) using Agile principles.

# User Experience Design
Wireframes, colour schemes, user flow chart go here
# Features
## Implemented
- “if comment.author == request.user:” in view is used to check at the back-end for authorship.
- Use metadata for enhanced superuser UX in admin panel.
- Pros and cons of classes vs functions.
- AllAuth used because it is a widely-used and secure thingy with many advanced features, and is simpler to implement than by using Django (avoids having to write extra code, forms and permissions).
- Set Debug to True for development but False before deployment/submission
