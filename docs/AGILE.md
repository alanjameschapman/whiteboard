# Agile Development

This project was developed using agile principles. The project took 4 weeks and was divide up into weekly iterations/timeboxes, which roughly coincided with scheduled mentor sessions. In this way, development was iterative and incremental. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was deployed after the first iteration for mentor and peer feedback.

Story Points were assigned to tasks at the start of the project, and after deployment of the MVP a velocity could be calculated from the number of story points completed within that week. In this way, the remaining work could be better prioritized.

- Product Backlog Issues (PBI's) are categorised and labelled as **user stories** or **bugs**.
- PBI's are managed and refined using GitHub's built-in Project functionality. Milestones are used to create the iterations/timeboxes.
- User Stories were designated with Story Points, which are relative measures of how much work is required to complete a chunk of work.
- Story Point values conform to the Fibonacci sequence i.e. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8. Anything larger was broken down into smaller chunks.
- A Kanban board was used as an Information Radiator, which was precise, accurate and updated coninuously.
- Each iteration aimed to have no more than 60% Must-Haves, 20% Should-haves, and 20% Could-haves, as shown below.

## Sprint 1

Having created all user stories and added them to the backlog, I prioritized planning and admin tasks using MoSCoW categorization as follows:

The Kanban was tailored to visualise work in progress and to be

At the end of sprint 1 it was calculated that over 20 hours of work, 6 user story points were completed, giving a velocity of 6/20 = 0.3 pts/hr.

It was established that the story points for sprint 1 issues were underestimated.

It was discussed at the mentor meeting that it would still be valuable to create a detailed user flow diagram but this could be deprioritized, as there was enough information on the wireframes to help build the project. Story points reduced from 2 to 1 due to some of the tasks within [user story #13](https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/issues/13) being completed.

## Sprint 2 - ends with Mentor Session 2 (Mid-Point Project Review)

Sprint 2 focused on creating a Minimum Viable Product for deployment on due date, where all merit criteria would be met. All user stories required for the MVP were added to this sprint.

Based on time taken for the django blog walkthrough, it was anticipated that these issues could be accomplished within the timebox.

## Sprint 3 - ends with Mentor Session 3 (Final Project Review)


## Sprint 4 - ends with Submit Full Stack Toolkit Portfolio Project
